# Dive into Deep Learning 

Author: Oualid Missaoui 

Scope: Studying the textbook https://d2l.ai/index.html


## Overview 

In this repos I study the Dive into Deep Learning textbook using PyTorch. 

I particularly attempt to clarify ambiguous mathematical derivations, answer the questions to the best of my ability, and restructure the code into a package to enhance readeability and facilitate potential extensions.


Added derivations and some exercises solutions are added in the   chapters notebooks on  a copy of the original notebooks under

The underlying  pytorch code used by the textbook is being re-structured under 

https://github.com/omroot/d2l_pytorch/tree/main/mylearnings/myd2l/omd2l


Each chapter experiments are consolidated under one single (for now) notebook 

https://github.com/omroot/d2l_pytorch/tree/main/mylearnings/myd2l/notebooks/refactored

that uses the refactored code under
