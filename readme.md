# Dive into Deep Learning 

Author: Oualid Missaoui 

Scope: Studying the textbook https://d2l.ai/index.html


## Overview 

In this repos I study the Dive into Deep Learning textbook using PyTorch. 

I particularly attempt to clarify ambiguous mathematical derivations, answer the questions to the best of my ability, and restructure the code into a package to enhance readeability and facilitate potential extensions.
